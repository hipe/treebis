# treebis

## summary
minimal single-file rake-like task DSL for wrapping common filesystem tasks like copying files.


## description
Treebis is a minimal, general scripting/task utility written in ruby that wraps common actions for moving, copying and altering filetrees.  It is geared towards things like generators.  It is comparable to a shell script that does a lot of mkdir, mv, cp commmands etc.


## what it is:
  - task wrapper for external commands that make filetrees, e.g.
    - maybe the generators in things like rails, ramaze, nandoc
  - proxy around FileUtils that allows customizing its output
  - copies filetrees to filetrees
  - removes filetrees from filetrees
  - applies diffs to filetrees
  - different ways to represent trees and diffs - heredocs, diffs, filesystem.
  - under 1000 SLOC
  - rcov test coverage usually hovers between 95-100%

## what it is not:
  - a vcs or vcs wrapper (version control system)
  - atomic

## frequently asked questions

### Q: why use it?
<span class='answer'>A</span>: Because you want a consistent way to wrap these common tasks that doesn't explicitly rely on shelling out to the underlying system, or other hodgepodges.  (also see 'why did you make this?' below)

### Q: why not use it?
<span class='answer'>A</span>: Because it doesn't do what you want or it does what you do not want.

### Q: why is it named "Treebis?"
<span class='answer'>A</span>: because it rhymes with "Jeebus."

### Q: why did you make this?
<span class='answer'>A</span>: by the third or fourth time i found myself re-writing this same kind of thing for different projects, or bleeding from its absence, i decided to abstract it.  It's more readable than a bunch of FileUtils statements,  it paves the way for possible future enhancements like atomicitiy and units of work; and wouldn't it be nice if every generator of every project used the same library?

## requirements
  - ruby 1.8.7
  - Treebis supports the application of unified diffs to single files
      and whole directories.  If this functionality is desired,
      Treebis was developed with GNU `patch` 2.5.8.  Most versions of patch
      will likely work.

## installation

### install the gem:

from the command line:
~~~
~ > gem install treebis
~~~


### or grab the file:
